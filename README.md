# Coding-Patterns
This repo shares a strategy to follow in order to prepare for coding interviews. Using a Systematic approach we can solve 350+ problems within one month. The idea is to map new problems onto problems that you have already solved, and only focus on the different constraints this problem has compared to the parent problem. This repo lists a set of problem patterns that will help you to quickly map a problem to an already-known one.

 ## 1. Pattern : Two pointers
When we deal with sorted arrays (or LinkedLists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the Two Pointers approach becomes quite useful. Related Leetcode problems :
